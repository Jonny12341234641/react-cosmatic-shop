XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language used to store and transport data. It is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML uses tags to define elements and a tree structure to organize data.

Key points about XML:
- Tags are user-defined and must be properly nested.
- XML is platform-independent and widely used for data exchange.
- It does not display data but describes the structure and meaning of data.
- Example:
    <note>
        <to>Kavin</to>
        <from>Copilot</from>
        <message>Hello, this is an XML note!</message>
    </note>
- XML files usually have a `.xml` extension.

XML is commonly used in web services, configuration files, and data storage.
